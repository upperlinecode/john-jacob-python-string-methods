# Let's use some methods to manipulate the string stored in name.

name = "John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt"

# 1. Use print and a built-in method to print out the string "jOHN jACOB jINGLEHEIMER sCHMIDT"


# 2. Use print and a built-in method to print out the string "JOHN JACOB JINGELHEIMER SCHMIDT"


# 3. Use print and a built-in method to count how many times the letter i is in Mr. Schmidt's name.


# 4. Use print and a built-in method to print out Mr. Schmidt's name, but with all the instances of the letter i removed or deleted.


# 5. Use print and a built-in function to find out how many characters are in Mr. Schmidt's name.
## NOTE that since this is a function and not a method, the best solution won't be on the string methods page - you'll need to Google this one. 


# 6. Use a built-in method to replace every letter J with the letter G instead. Bonus point if you can say the result out loud without laughing.


# 7. Chain a few methods together to print out the string with all the vowels removed. 


# 8. Try to print the name as four separate strings by using a function that will split it up like this: ["John", "Jacob", "Jingleheimer", "Schmidt"]


# 9. Print out only the first four letters of the string.


# 10. Print out only the first ten letters of the string but make them all uppercase.


# 11. CHALLENGE: Try to print out the string "tdimhcS remiehelgniJ bocaJ nhoJ" (which is the name backwards)


# 12. CHALLENGE: Chain two methods together to print out the string "TDIMHCS REMIEHELGNIJ BOCAJ NHOJ", (which is the name in uppercase and backwards).
